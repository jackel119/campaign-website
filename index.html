              <p>This past year, I've already contributed heavily to DoCSoc's academic events, including holding a talk at the start of the year to help first-years become acclimated to Unix environments, helping kickstart DoCSoc CTF (who are now going to competitions and representing DoCSoc!), and organizing DoCSoc Education. As AEC, I'd like to carry on the success that Rachel's had this year as well as build more on top of the foundations that have been laid for future Academic Events.</p>

              <p>This year marks the first year that DoCSoc has hosted reading groups delivered by DoC's academics about their current ongoing research. Next year, I'd like to try hosting even more reading groups, as well as making them more accessible. Whilst the reading groups this year were very successful, I believe that there is also an opportunity for academics to also talk more about their general field of research such that (advanced) 1st years and 2nd years will be able benefit from them as well.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-0">Student-Led Workshops and Talks</h3>
              <p>Continuing to host student-led educational talks and workshops. Within the realm of Computer Science, there's such a vast range of knowledge and skills, and many students are keen on sharing their own. For example, the recent Docker workshop by Abhinav and the Web Development course last year were incredibly popular and covered content that isn't part of our JMC/Computing degrees. As AEC, I'd quite like to push for more students to share their knowledge and give educational talks and workshops to other students.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-0">Promoting a more active DoCSoc Software Foundation</h3>
              <p>DoCSoc Software Foundation is our initiative to encourage our students to get into Open Source Development. Currently, we've lost momentum and the only projects there are the ones that committee members have started at the beginning of the year. I would quite like to promote and advertise this initiative more, espescially for younger years who I believe will benefit a lot from learning to contribute to such projects - for example, projects involving machine learning models aren't really covered until 3rd year, but they are relatively easy to learn about after becoming relatively competent at programming. Another example would be simply just picking up a new language e.g. Python or Javascript that isn't technically covered in DoC by doing a project that utilises it. I believe there's a large opportunity for learning about software development (in general, not just open source) for people who are interested in the projects on DoCSoc SF. Also, trusted developers can review and give feedback to pull request, which I believe goes with our philosophy of learning from each other.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-0">Establishing DoCSoc as Imperial's go-to society for learning about technology</h3>
              <p>Given Imperial's strong STEM background, many students from all courses have a strong interest in learning about technologies like Machine Learning / Artificial Inteligence, Blockchains, etc, as well as modern society's tech-related issues such as Net Neutrality, Privacy and Mass Surveilance amongst many others. I believe DoCSoc can have a bigger role to play within the whole college - for example, holding debates, or talks from our passionate students that are open to non-DoCSoc members, or engaging with many of our media-related societies (Felix, ICRadio, ICTV...) and establishing DoCSoc as THE place to go to when it comes to all things technology and computing.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-0">DoCSoc Education</h3>
              <p>DoCSoc Education is essentially DoCSoc's "outreach". In the past, we've had many requests from other Departmental Societies for providing them with some sort of coding course, due to the fact that coding is becoming an increasingly demanded skill in many industries, and other Departments don't cover it. This year, we listened and started "DoCSoc Education", which tries to fulfill that goal. Currently, we're giving a series of Python lectures/workshops to (primarily) Bio/BioChem/BioMed  students, and so far the feedback has been excellent. Not only does this promote DoCSoc's brand name to other departments, but it also offers our students a chance to learn and develop their public speaking and teaching skills. I'm proud to say this has been something I've been in charge of, and that next year I'd quite like to keep doing more initiatives like this. Admittedly, I'm not 100% sure on where we'll go next, as that does depend on other DepSocs' requests, but I'm confident this is something I can definitely keep going.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-0">CTF Team</h3>
              <p>You may remember that near the start of the year, we made asked how interested people would be in doing CTF challenges and potentially putting together a DoCSoc team. Thanks to the hard work of Aurel (2nd year Computing) and Rodrigo (PhD student), that has now culminated in weekly CTF meetups where students can come learn and practice hacking and security skills, and are soon to be competing in multiple tournaments across the country representing not just DoCSoc but Imperial College as well. Continuing to support this programme and recruit more students interested in this area is definitely one of my goals for next year.</p>
